# HR-Analytics

**Tools Used:** Power BI (DAX), Excel, PDF Export

**Objective:** Built an interactive HR dashboard to uncover employee attendance trends, work-from-home behavior, and leave pattern deviations over a 3-month period.

**ðŸ”§ Data Handling & Transformation**
â€¢ Parsed over 8,000+ daily attendance logs across 70+ employees for Marâ€“May 2025.
â€¢ Cleaned raw logs by mapping codes like P, WFH, HLWP, HSL, etc., and handling edge cases like overlapping entries or non-working days.

**ðŸ“ˆ Analytical Highlights**
â€¢ Achieved 90.90% overall attendance insight and flagged 3+ policy violations (e.g., excessive HLWP or unexplained absences).
â€¢ WFH trends peaked on Sundays (100%) and Thursdays (17.2%) â€“ enabling HR to reassess remote work policies.
â€¢ Identified high-risk profiles (e.g., 0% presence with repeated leave misuse) and consistent performers (100% presence).

**ðŸ“Š Visualization & Design**
â€¢ Delivered a Power BI dashboard with dynamic filters (by date, employee, status).
â€¢ Designed day-of-week heatmaps, employee-level summaries, and time series graphs to support HR decision-making.
â€¢ Exported the analysis to a PDF format for stakeholder-ready presentations.

**ðŸš€ Business Impact**
â€¢ Empowered HR to take action on underperforming attendance behavior and reinforce WFH governance.
â€¢ Created a repeatable framework to monitor real-time attendance patterns and pre-empt compliance issues.
